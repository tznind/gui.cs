uid: Terminal.Gui.Views
summary: The `Views` namespace contains the complete collection of built-in UI controls and widgets.
---

@Terminal.Gui.Views provides a comprehensive set of pre-built user interface controls, derived from @Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View, that cover common application needs. From simple labels and buttons to complex data grids and tree views, this namespace contains production-ready controls with consistent behavior, theming, and accessibility support.

All Views in this namespace are built on the @Terminal.Gui.ViewBase.View foundation and inherit the complete feature set including adornments, scrolling, focus management, and user arrangement capabilities.

For a complete list of all views with examples, see the [List of Views](~/docs/views.md) page.
