# This file configures GitVersion 6.x to work with Terminal.Gui's GitFlow branching strategy.
#
# Terminal.Gui uses the GitFlow branching strategy.
# https://gitversion.net/docs/learn/branching-strategies/gitflow/
#
# - We have two main branches: `v2_release` and `v2_develop`.
# - `v2_release` is the main branch for V2 releases and matches the latest NuGet release package (e.g., 2.0.0);
#   prior to release, it uses pre-release labels (e.g., 2.0.0-prealpha.1).
# - `v2_develop` is the development branch for V2 and always carries a pre-release label (e.g., 2.1.0-develop.1).
# - Development happens on feature branches off `v2_develop`.
# - For releases, we merge feature branches into `v2_develop`, then `v2_develop` into `v2_release`.
# - The ./.github/workflows/publish.yml builds and publishes on pushes to `v2_develop` and `v2_release`.
#
# Branches:
# - v1_release: Main branch for V1 (historical)
# - v1_develop: Develop branch for V1 (historical)
# - v2_release: Main branch for V2
# - v2_develop: Develop branch for V2
#
# Package Naming:
# - from v2_develop: 2.1.0-develop.1 (minor version increments)
# - from v2_release (pre-release): 2.0.0-prealpha.1 or 2.0.0-beta.1
# - from v2_release (release): 2.0.0 (patch version increments)
#
mode: ContinuousDelivery   # GitVersion 6.x uses Mainline mode for GitFlow, focusing on main branch releases

# We prefix our tags with 'v' or 'V' (e.g., v1.0.0)
